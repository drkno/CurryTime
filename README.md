# CurryTime

Coming Soon: A more geeky way to order your curry (and with a web UI for those that arn't CLI purists).

```
   ____                   _______ _                
 / ____|                 |__   __(_)               
| |    _   _ _ __ _ __ _   _| |   _ _ __ ___   ___ 
| |   | | | | '__| '__| | | | |  | | '_ ` _ \ / _ \
| |___| |_| | |  | |  | |_| | |  | | | | | | |  __/
 \_____\__,_|_|  |_|   \__, |_|  |_|_| |_| |_|\___|
                        __/ |                      
                       |___/                       

An option must be specified.
Avalible arguments are:
	show		Shows a list of the avalible curries.
	add			Adds a curry or other item to your current order.
	modify		Modifies the last order.
	remove		Removes an item from your current order.
	order		Places your order on the set remote.
	status		Retreives the status of your current order.
	tag			Tag as a favorite.
	blame		Blames all the people who ordered a particular item.
	config		Configures curry-time.

Another exceptionally useless creation by Matthew Knox and Dion Woolley.
